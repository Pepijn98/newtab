# Kyra
A clean personal new tab page

## About
A simplistic new tab page with my most used bookmarks. \
Inspired by [Styleads/homless](https://github.com/Styleads/homless), took their layout idea and made it more responsive for smaller windows etc. \
Feel free to clone, fork and modify however you want.

## Install
To install this as an extension, go to the extension page of whatever chromium browser you have and load unpacked extension. \
To get the search bar working you need to have [Pepijn98/kyra-search-suggestions](https://github.com/Pepijn98/kyra-search-suggestions) backend running on a server and create a `js/.env.js` with username, password and baseUrl.
