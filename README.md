# Kyra
A clean personal new tab page \
_Probably works on most browsers, only tested on edge and firefox_

## About
A simplistic new tab page with my most used bookmarks. \
Inspired by [Styleads/homless](https://github.com/Styleads/homless), took their layout idea and made it more responsive for smaller windows etc. \
Feel free to clone, fork and modify however you want.
